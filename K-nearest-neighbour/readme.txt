Implementing a function that realizes an n-nearest neighbor classifier, i.e. a
function that decides the class label of a test data point from the majority
of the labels among the n nearest training data.
Download the files data2-train.dat and data2-test.dat of labeled
2D data and determine the recognition accuracy (percentage of correctly
classified data points) of your classifier for n ? {1, 3, 5}.
Determine the overall run time for computing the 1-nearest neighbor of
every data in data2-test.dat.
